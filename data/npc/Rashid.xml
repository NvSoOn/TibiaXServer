	<parameter key="keyword_reply1" value="I am a travelling trader. I don't buy everything, though. And not from everyone, for that matter." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="I am Rashid, son of the desert." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="Of course, old friend. You can also browse only armor, legs, shields, helmets, boots, weapons, enchanted weapons, jewelry or miscellaneous stuff." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="Elves... I don't really trust them. All this talk about nature and flowers and treehugging... I'm sure there's some wicked scheme behind all this." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="My beloved hometown! Ah, the sweet scent of the desert sands, the perfect shape of the pyramids... stunningly beautiful." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="I have to go to Karmia once in a while, since the queen wishes to see my exclusive wares in regular intervals." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="Cormaya? Not a good place to make business, it's way too far and small." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="It's not the real thing, but almost as good. The merchants there claim ridiculous prices, which is fine for my own business." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="Ah yes, Premy Island! Such a lovely and quiet island! I usually make some nice business there." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="Too few customers there, it's not worth the trip." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply11" value="Um... I don't think so." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply12" value="I don't like being underground much. I also tend to get lost in these labyrinthine dwarven tunnels, so I rather avoid them." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply13" value="When you avoid the slums, it's a really pretty city. Almost as pretty as the governor's daughter." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply14" value="Um... I don't think so." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply15" value="I like the settlement itself, but I don't set my foot into the jungle. Have you seen the size of these centipedes??" />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply16" value="Um... I don't think so." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply17" value="I wish it was a little bit warmer there, but with a good mug of barbarian mead in your tummy everything gets a lot cosier." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply18" value="I feel uncomfortable and rather unsafe in Thalia, so I don't really travel there." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply19" value="Um... I don't think so." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply20" value="Although it's the flourishing trade centre of Tibia, I don't like going there. Too much competition for my taste." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply21" value="It's almost time to journey on." />
	<parameter key="keyword_reply22" value="Kings, queens, emperors and kaliphs... everyone claims to be different and unique, but actually it's the same thing everywhere." />
